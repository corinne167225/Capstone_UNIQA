If you are thinking about taking out business loss insurance or if you already have one, I can only recommend that you refrain from doing so or cancel the insurance. Your contract contains a clause that in the event of permanent incapacity to work, the contract will be terminated The payments will be stopped with immediate effect. In concrete terms, it works like this: a medical expert commissioned and paid by the insurance company will confirm your permanent incapacity for work after a certain period of time on the basis of the findings provided by your treating doctor. This enables the insurance company to accept your contract with immediate effect Cancel and stop payments. So if you are a doctor who has gone blind or a carpenter who has lost his hands or a locksmith who has cancer, this means permanent disability for the insurance company. Do not expect your insurance advisor to tell you about these circumstances because in most cases he doesn't know the exact details of the contract you signed or he simply doesn't care because of the expected final premium.

Now it's only been 1 year and they're announcing the third policy increase! With every submission you have to submit countless documents, many benefits are rejected and you have to discuss and now this. Overall, the insurance was increased by over €60 in one year and the benefit amount for individual services was even reduced by €75. In addition, the change is uploaded to the portal on a weekend, 9 days before it comes into force, and the consumer is not even informed about it.

I cannot recommend Uniqa and I am glad that I have my insurance with another company.

Not only is the performance of the fund managers very weak (-10% in the last 3 years, in comparison DAX approx. +10%, MSCi World +20%), the customer service is also very weak!
