1,Beautiful tower by river side in the view downtown.,0.8,Positive
2,"The worst private insurance company. I pay every month, but still I had to pay at the doctor's office for a visit and they are not paying back! They are looking for ways not to pay their customers. Never again!",-0.95,Negative
3,"This is not an insurance company, this from our car insurance experience is a scamming company that will use each and every possible little loophole in the law to trap you into policies that you can only cancel when they feel like it. So pretty much they will steal from you. Stay away!!!",-0.95,Negative
4,"The company is trying to scam you out of your money at each step. First of all, they will include EVERYTHING that you potentially might have in the future. All kinds of illnesses, things that come with age. This way they are not working with statistical probability and Big Data that works on large numbers. They make sure they profit from each and every customer, even if all insurance cases will occur. So at no risk for UNIQA. Second, even in cases where you followed the procedures and forwarded invoices to the company, they try to weasel out of payment. Claiming that they are unable to wire the money due to some missing information they don't try to solve it. They just close a case at every step in hope that a customer busy and forgets about this or is too tired to jump over all the hops. Not sure whether other private insurance companies are better (probably not), but this is my experience with this one. EDIT: 14 days later after complaint via E-Mail and the App and still no progress. One would think that the company will use the chance to make things right, but apparently not this one.",-0.85,Negative
5,"My experience with this insurance company begun with question of immediate getting the insurance for residence permit. Here everything was smooth and fast. Later I had an accident and then money were returned but not as fast as expected eventhough I had all documents needed. Until this point I had recommended this company. When I had to cancel my insurance something strange happened: they ""couldn't charge"" money from my account and waited 4 months to inform me! Added extra fee and told to pay. Email was from new email address, no stamps or signatures - just information. I tried to find out was it a spam or not but didn't get it. After 8!!! months I was contacted again with the same request. Appeared that it might be not a spam and it was explained to me why but still no stamps or anything official. Total anarchy and low level of service. Definitely wouldn't recommend now. P.S. I paid that amount in order to forget about it but still not sure if it was right decision or not.",-0.75,Negative
6,The worst insurance company that I have ever seen. Nobody picks the phone up there if you were in an urgent case. Not recommended at all.,-0.95,Negative

14,"The worst experience I ever had with an insurance. I had the accident insurance for 16 years and when I needed it for the first time, they kept me on hold and refused with pseudo-arguments that were neither logical nor medically justified. Nothing works without a lawsuit, which they seem to have aimed for. In case of emergency, having to sue, especially when you are already medically challenged, is really the last resort.",-0.9,Negative
15,"NO STAR! In the course of a bank change, unfortunately, I overlooked to continue the debiter of UNIQA. Received no reminders or reminders from UNIQA (also no hint of missing insurance coverage) and then a court claim after 2 months out of the blue. According to a telephone inquiry with the insurance, this does not have to take care of reminders, but I have to take care that the premiums are paid. Great when you only find out about the outstanding premiums through the court.... PS: It was about a monthly premium of 15,- Euro which I certainly did not want to evade. NEVER AGAIN! Insurance already terminated.",-0.8,Negative

17,"Completely overpriced life insurance, which despite 25 years of payment despite booming stock markets only generates the return that you could have achieved in a savings account without an insurance component, it's actually a negative return. Stay away.",-0.95,Negative
18,"If you have no problem with your insurance, everything is going great. However, the first problem arises, the insurance sends ""reinforcement"" and does not pay. Too bad that many of these reviews are not posted here.",-0.7,Negative

The game repeats itself I want you to keep generating, but also know that this is a negative review with composite score maybe -0.7.",-0.7,Negative
41,"I have been insured there for years with my Hartlauer glasses and a separate legal protection insurance. I have not made any insurance claims in these years. Now the termination of my legal protection insurance is not accepted, as it apparently arrived a few days (<5 days) late at the headquarters. I will now also have my glasses insured elsewhere.",-0.7,Negative
42,"I was wrongly advised by a Uniqa company adviser on a household insurance. When I then had a case after years, it was not paid. The adviser coincidentally no longer existed.",-0.5,Negative
43,"Hmm... The employees are very nice when you want to take out insurance, but as soon as you have questions about existing insurance, you have to wait 😡😡😡 a long time until someone answers. Afterwards it turns out that the person is not responsible for it (SIMPLY HAS NO IDEA) and keeps connecting and connecting 😡😡😡. I simply had the feeling that I was just being messed around with. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 NEVER AGAIN!!!!",-0.8,Negative
44,"WARNING RACIAL PROFILING Unfortunately, the registration office engages in racial profiling, therefore not recommended for someone with an immigrant background. My question to the Uniqa team: how long will this go on?",-0.8,Negative
45,I have been waiting for over two months for processing. Inquiries are either not answered at all or you are fobbed off with delaying tactics. This is not the first time it has happened - I wouldn't be moved to sign anything with this company again.,-0.8,Negative

47,"Be careful with this company! They do not answer emails, no calls. I have already received a couple of executions from them twice because I did not ""pay"". Please note that I have not received any letters from them to pay for anything. They also did not send me any reminders. The worst insurance company in Austria!",-0.9,Negative
48,"after a basement break-in with wheel theft, there have been no updates for 4 weeks a surveyor was sent (for whatever reason) you do not receive any information about the further procedure unless you ask ........... next step I will seek a lawyer and set a deadline at Uniqa's expense then they can also pay for it I will cancel all insurance policies after the case is closed because this is not how you treat long-standing customers",-0.7,Negative
49,"Uniqa would actually deserve negative points, but unfortunately it is not possible. Uniqa is a pure nuisance!!! It took a year for all data in the policy to finally be correct. I am still waiting for a ridiculous 77 euros since July!!! It is repeatedly claimed that documents have not been received. Then the tip, you should try it via the app, it's faster. Still waiting for the access data today. Communicated by email again... allegedly they have not received the confirmation again. There's no point in calling, it doesn't help either. There cannot be so much incompetence, it's all intentional. Stop treating your customers like idiots! Apparently there is no customer service anymore. What has become of your company!!!? My data is up to date, so I can be reached by mail, email, and phone at any time.",-0.9,Negative
50,"A juice shop like no other, I am lucky to be insured with insurance companies that place great value on customer satisfaction. Unfortunately, I had to endure the service from Uniqa when I was the victim of the damage & the cause of the damage is insured with the great Uniqa. I have been struggling with this for almost two months to call again and again & to ask how the current progress of my damage is. I was always told - ""is still in progress"" today after a slightly different tone on my part, I managed to find out that my cause of damage has not yet made a statement. If I hadn't asked again, the deadline would have expired & just left standing like that. Thank you Uniqa, hopefully your top service will soon collapse!",-0.8,Negative
51,"I have been insured with UNIQA for more than 50 years (formerly Austria Col.). It is good to have the insurance and preferably not need it. When I needed it, I can only praise the quick and correct handling. From my point of view, I can only recommend this insurance. But where there is a lot of light, there is also shadow. I must supplement my review insofar as the UNIQA INSURANCE has now fully supported me in the difficult phase for me (Cancer Therapy). Thank you very much for your help. Please remain as uncomplicated in handling medical cases as in the past!",0.8,Positive
52,Last-class customer service - would most like to cancel all my insurance policies. Will complain about the gentleman on the hotline. Rarely experienced such rudeness - and the fault lies with Uniqa!!!!,-0.7,Negative
53,"Dear ladies and gentlemen of Uniqa, after your employee sold us the wrong insurance package and has since been unreachable (before everything went flawlessly - until the insurance was concluded), I would like to give feedback on this. I am deeply disappointed and will warn all people in my environment who want to take out insurance about your handling of your customers. If you want to get in touch with me, I can give you more information - even about whom it is.",-0.7,Negative
54,"Also, I had an insurance with Uniqua and was dissatisfied, is still a strong understatement. The insurance enriches itself through inappropriately high reminder fees, through extremely long notice periods as well as extremely high costs compared to other insurances to its customers. There is no customer service there. Last year I canceled my legal expenses insurance and after a year of notice period, it will fortunately expire on April 1st. Once and never again!",-0.8,Negative
55,"When collecting, very fast, when paying out benefits, very good at dodging. Private health insurance and supplementary insurance should be legally prohibited and the public health system expanded and qualitatively upgraded!",-0.8,Negative
56,Hands off this insurance. Repeated problems with billing. I have been trying to cancel this insurance for months and every time it is delayed. Now I have to involve a lawyer against this insurance. Can only advise against this insurance.,-0.8,Negative
57,"Customer service very, very unqualified and unfriendly. No idea what the customer needs or what information is required. These people live off us!!!!! We pay for it!!! How can such a thing as UNIQA afford it???? The large houses are built by us customers. Catastrophe!!!!! The bills never match!!!!",-0.8,Negative

59,I called five times about a claim and was redirected to the rating survey every time (!) after about 15 to 20 minutes. The competition was now able to help me further.,-0.8,Negative
60,"Catastrophe. Apparently, you should mention the opening hours on the answering machine, hung like a fool from 15.50 was still open until 16.10 on the answering machine. Probably didn't want to do any work at 15.50, so went straight to the answering machine. Luckily I won't have much to do with this insurance soon.",-0.7,Negative
61,"I can absolutely recommend this insurance. This recommendation applies only in the following case: You want to be left with the bill in the event of a claim. For everyone else, Uniqa unfortunately cannot be recommended from my point of view. What happened: I had a traffic accident with a parking damage. Now the insurance does not cover it. Reason: The parked car was in reverse. After refuting this absurd theory, the insurance still does not cover it. Reason: According to the expert, the damage could not have occurred like this. Although the accident was meticulously recorded and photographed (including a witness), the insurance does not pay. The responsible Mr. R. sounds absolutely uninterested on the phone. (Statement: Then sue us.)",-0.8,Negative
62,"An insurance policyholder (L17 driver) of this insurance ran into my stationary car. The claims adjuster presented the photos of my damaged car ""to a court-certified expert who happened to be in the building"" and had him confirm that my car was in motion (and not the other). He was able to prove that beyond doubt (based on photos!!!!). I know that insurance companies are out to minimize damages, but I have never experienced a more dubious approach to ""clarify"" a matter! Simply unprofessional.",-0.8,Negative
63,"I cannot understand the many bad reviews here. If I want advice, I get it. If not, they leave me alone - something that is very important to me because other insurance companies always want to present their new products and annoy me with them. The packages are not the cheapest, but there are also many that are more expensive. So I would say: midfield. Also, what concerns the ""beauty"", that is the design, of various components of the offers (the documents, emails, also parts of the website...) there is certainly still room for improvement. But Uniqa is unbeatable in one thing, and that is with the Bicycle insurance! This is totally - yes: TOTALLY unmatched in the market! (And if I'm wrong about that, please enlighten me!) For me, as a compulsive frequent cyclist, the main reason why I am with Uniqa.",0.5,Positive

65,"I am a customer and at the same time an opponent of the insurance in the event of a motor vehicle accident. What I had to hear from the representative here borders on mockery. The result will be that it will be even more expensive for the insurance company, as I now have to involve legal protection (also at Uniqa). And please no comment with the general hotline, I can make fun of myself alone.",-0.8,Negative
66,"A very bad insurance that you can never trust, I am really disappointed by the insurance must give five thumbs down all five stars 👎👎👎👎👎",-0.8,Negative
67,WARNING about Uniqa. This company advertises with false facts and tries with all tricks to prevent a payout of insurance benefits. A friend who had the same insurance case was immediately paid by Wiener Städtische without any problems. Outrageous. I will advise all comrades against Uniqa before the next foreign mission and advertise for other insurances.,-0.8,Negative

69,"Due to an urgent matter, I visited customer service at the Uniqa Tower, after which Mrs. Doppler from customer service contacted me by phone and together with the team did her best to solve the matter quickly - which they succeeded in doing. Many thanks to the whole team for the quick processing and handling of my concern.",0.8,Positive
70,"Also actually zero stars! I usually don't write reviews, but in this case, I have to: Yesterday I received a letter that was already sent in August (according to the date of issue) to an address that I haven't lived in for over 10 years (btw: the postal code was also wrong) - with a demand for a policy that I never took out. And today, to top it all off, a demand for three supposed outstanding claims for this policy plus dunning fees from a lawyer arrives... Extremely irritated by the two letters, I called the Uniqa call center to clarify this",-0.8,Negative

I highly recommend her as a consultant..",0.8,Positive
