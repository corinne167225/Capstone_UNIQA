"Eternal waiting times, one practically has to beg for a callback. The employees are asleep.",-0.7,Negative
"No feedback on emails, long waiting times for payouts, very disappointing!",-0.8,Negative
"They scam you from start to finish, don't let you cancel, and always find excuses. The phone service is also incompetent, claiming cancellation is not possible. No help was provided. When the contract extended for another year, suddenly cancellation was possible... so they could get paid for another year. ""We wish we had your worries"" - This insurance is my only worry.",-0.9,Negative
"Very bad and bordering on fraud with their contracts where the employees only work for good commissions to make profits. And only for the benefit of the Wiener St√§dtische insurance. In my case, it was a funeral insurance for funeral costs. I received less than what I deposited. If I had saved my money, I would have been much better off with a few thousand euros more for my mother's funeral. I can't recommend anyone to use this insurance. And I could have paid almost 2000 euros more for my mother's funeral. And the worst part was that when my mother died, they were still debiting the installments from my account. That says it all about such an insurance, never again Wienerstaedtische!!!!!!!!!",-0.95,Negative
"Unfriendly, rude, and arrogant. If possible, I would have given 0 stars. I had a claim, was told over the phone that the bill would be covered, but they didn't. They even blocked my phone number so I couldn't complain. Couldn't believe it.",-0.85,Negative
"I would say it depends on the advisor you choose independently, and just saying that the Wiener St√§dtische doesn't cover or do anything is unfair; if that's the case, all insurances are the same. It just depends on the customer service and whether the advisor is there for you! And if you can express yourself really (normally) what you as a customer or policyholder need and require.",0.7,Positive
"I have been dissatisfied for a long time. In 7 years, I had 5 insurance claims, of which 3 were rejected... As a customer, you constantly feel let down.",-0.8,Negative
"I bought a new car and got a better insurance contract from my insurance agent. The contract with St√§dtische was terminated, but I still hadn't received the outstanding ‚Ç¨420 after 6 months. Only after several written complaints did I get my money back. I'm convinced that if I'm a few days overdue with a contribution, the insurance coverage is no longer valid, and I receive a reminder. But the insurance doesn't pay out the money that doesn't belong to them for months.",-0.9,Negative
"The slogan shouldn't be ""we want your worries"", but rather ""we want your money"". Three years as a customer with car insurance. During that time, the premium has already increased by 50%. After a claim, I am now being terminated. This insurance is an absolute disaster. Stay away from it.",-0.9,Negative
"Internal communication doesn't work at all, handling requests takes a very long time and is very chaotic, so much so that it's difficult for oneself to keep an overview. For me as a customer, it's very time and energy-consuming to get in touch and get requests processed. Overall very unsatisfactory!",-0.8,Negative
"Nothing but jokes.. unfortunately, there are no -stars... completely incompetent employees.. who don't even ask when registering a car and type in errors but charge twice for registration and re-registration... so I'm not surprised by their motto ""we want your worries""...",-0.9,Negative
"After canceling an ""accident insurance"" that is worthless unless you are an insurance expert and can print out and fill out a mountain of forms lying in the hospital bed and return them, I can still pay for a whole year, because the end of the year with this club is in October....k...",-0.85,Negative
"I wasn't informed about the ""comprehensive insurance application."" With the first damage (stone impact), ‚Ç¨1000 deductible was charged instead of the agreed ‚Ç¨300. Although I can prove with pictures that there was no stone impact at the time of purchase, the ""concession"" was then (allegedly) a reduction to ‚Ç¨660 -- allegedly because I have been waiting for the refund for months. Now the premium has also been increased.",-0.85,Negative
My new optical glasses were accidentally damaged by my grandson. Value ‚Ç¨650. My son-in-law filed the claim. ‚Ç¨50 was approved. Thank you St√§dtische. Good insurance. Mainly cashing inü§ë,0.75,Positive
"I had problems with health insurance, they didn't want to pay me my health insurance money even though I was entitled to it. I was even at a crappy insurance and paid for my policy for 1 year. I went to the insurance company and wanted to get a lawyer's help, and my lawyer was denied! With the excuse that the crappy policy wasn't paid for this month even though the money was always debited from the account, the account was always in the plus because of this! What happened, I canceled the policy in 2022. Then I went to the Chamber of Labor and filed a complaint against the health insurance company and got my money. And in 2024, I was told that the health insurance and AMS would not be covered, even though it was initially said that it was covered. The insurance doesn't cover AMS benefits if you get a suspension, even if it's not justified, and health insurance money is also not included in the insurance because the insurance sees that you cannot win a legal dispute. People who are unemployed or seriously ill don't need this crappy insurance, as they are left alone in the fight.",-0.95,Negative
"Despite cancellation for 3 years, money is debited from my account??? I wrote 30 emails about it, and the only response was that the email would be forwarded?? They don't respond to emails or calls either!! From me, 0.0 stars! Customer service doesn't exist either :)",-0.9,Negative
"Partly my fault, partly a misunderstanding - I got in trouble with the property management, and they wanted to kick me out. I turned to Wiener St√§dtische for help, as I had legal expenses insurance there. Although I have free choice of lawyer, I was forced by the insurance to consult their lawyers. They collected all the information from me and instead of helping me, they used everything against me to refuse help. Moreover, it is obvious that they simply did not understand half of it, but did not clarify or question it - no interest. I solved the problem with the property management myself.",-0.9,Negative
"The customer service email has not responded to my inquiry for several weeks. I continue to receive mail for which I am not responsible, including threats of legal action against a deceased person (I am not the heir).",-0.8,Negative

"You pay insurance premiums for decades, but when you then claim a benefit from the insurance, you get terminated! Stay away from this insurance company!!!",-0.9,Negative
"Service modest... and that's putting it more than friendly. Due to a fall down the stairs, I lost two front teeth. First of all, it was a true obstacle course to obtain the form for the accident report from the dentist! The employee is not really one responsible, I think it's like a raffle - draw a ticket and then see what or who comes out. The question about the extent of the coverage of the damage remains unanswered. Statements are rather kept in such a way that everything can be interpreted. But the payments are expected punctually - only God forbid you need a service. I strongly advise against this insurance. It's more of an impertinence how you are treated as a customer here. I'm chasing after the answers rather than having them answered at the first email. Bad is still friendly - I'm sure there are better accident insurances.",-0.95,Negative
I have been a customer for 25 years (HHV) and no matter what it is about - they never pay. They always find some diabolical small print to get out of it.,-0.85,Negative
