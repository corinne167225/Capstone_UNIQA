They are looking for ways not to pay their customers. Never again!\\nEdit: Dear Uniqa I tried calling the number you shared but it is not working. You have my info so please feel free to contact me. I managed to have a fairly unpleasant conversation with one of your representatives by calling the phone number on the letter which was sent to inform me that one of my claims will not be covered. For other claims they want to contact doctor every time I submit claim. Which would be great if it was done properly. I talked to my drs office and they never received any note from you. Another representative told me a new note was just sent while the first one told me only one note can be sent.\\nWho is lying?I would love to talk to someone before I have to contact a lawyer since it seems that at this point you do not want to reimburse my claims.

They make sure they profit from each and every customer, even if all insurance cases will occur. So at no risk for UNIQA.\\n\\nSecond, even in cases where you followed the procedures and forwarded invoices to the company, they try to weasel out of payment. Claiming, that they are unable to wire the money due to some missing information they don't try to solve it. They just close a case at every step in hope, that a customer busy and forgets about this or is too tired to jump over all the hops.\\n\\nNot sure, whether other private insurance companies are better (probably not), but this is my experience with this one.\\n\\nEDIT: 14 days later after complaint via E-Mail and the App and still no progress.
