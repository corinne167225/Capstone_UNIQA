"Very bad and bordering on fraud with their contracts where the employees only work for good commissions to make profits. And only for the benefit of the Wiener St√§dtische insurance. In my case, it was a funeral insurance for funeral costs. I received less than what I deposited. If I had saved my money, I would have been much better off with a few thousand euros more for my mother's funeral. I can't recommend anyone to use this insurance. And I could have paid almost 2000 euros more for my mother's funeral. And the worst part was that when my mother died, they were still debiting the installments from my account.

I went to the insurance company and wanted to get a lawyer's help, and my lawyer was denied! With the excuse that the crappy policy wasn't paid for this month even though the money was always debited from the account, the account was always in the plus because of this! What happened, I canceled the policy in 2022. Then I went to the Chamber of Labor and filed a complaint against the health insurance company and got my money. And in 2024, I was told that the health insurance and AMS would not be covered, even though it was initially said that it was covered. The insurance doesn't cover AMS benefits if you get a suspension, even if it's not justified, and health insurance money is also not included in the insurance because the insurance sees that you cannot win a legal dispute.

The employee is not really one responsible, I think it's like a raffle - draw a ticket and then see what or who comes out. The question about the extent of the coverage of the damage remains unanswered. Statements are rather kept in such a way that everything can be interpreted. But the payments are expected punctually - only God forbid you need a service. I strongly advise against this insurance. It's more of an impertinence how you are treated as a customer here.

"Donau Versicherung was my home and liability insurer. My then 6-year-old daughter damaged the neighbor's car paint. The insurance company did NOT want to take over this damage - the argumentation was absolutely not conclusive for me (also not for my insurance agent and lawyer) - from the email replies from the claims department it became clear to me that my emails were NOT read in a meaningful way. That really annoyed me, a customer who always paid on time should be given a fair damage assessment (which I don't think was the case in my opinion).

Despite previous punctual payments by SEPA direct debit (which is also a cheek, who books premiums at 3:45 a.m. - the Donau!) It was the case that Donauvers. demands its discount back if you terminate contracts (admittedly at the end of an insurance year but before the end of the term). This was not possible due to a lack of account cover (end of the month) and I received a letter with ""COLLECTION"" a few days later. This is how you deal with long-term customers after cancellations!!! What's more, these repayment claims are debited 2 months before the contract even ends. Not normal this action.

When reporting a claim, nothing was done for a long time, despite many calls and letters, by this insurance company. Only when I wanted to cancel did I get first reactions.
