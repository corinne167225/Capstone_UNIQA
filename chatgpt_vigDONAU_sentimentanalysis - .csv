"Visa accepts Donau Versicherung as travel insurance, they outsource part of the claims to Call us. Months pass before you receive any information about your submission.",-0.5,Negative
"Donau Versicherung was my home and liability insurer. My then 6-year-old daughter damaged the neighbor's car paint. The insurance company did NOT want to take over this damage - the argumentation was absolutely not conclusive for me (also not for my insurance agent and lawyer) - from the email replies from the claims department it became clear to me that my emails were NOT read in a meaningful way. That really annoyed me, a customer who always paid on time should be given a fair damage assessment (which I don't think was the case in my opinion). Since it was ""only"" about 350 euros in damage, I did not take the time-consuming legal route, although my lawyer saw a good chance of success. I have now canceled Donau Versicherung because of the experiences.",-0.8,Negative
"No more Donau Versicherung - Despite the alleged discount, the premiums are still much more expensive than with other insurers for poorer services. Despite previous punctual payments by SEPA direct debit (which is also a cheek, who books premiums at 3:45 a.m. - the Donau!) It was the case that Donauvers. demands its discount back if you terminate contracts (admittedly at the end of an insurance year but before the end of the term). This was not possible due to a lack of account cover (end of the month) and I received a letter with ""COLLECTION"" a few days later. This is how you deal with long-term customers after cancellations!!! What's more, these repayment claims are debited 2 months before the contract even ends. Not normal this action. My whole family is still with this Donau Versicherung - but not for long !!!! NEVER MORE DANUBE - MUCH TOO EXPENSIVE - CUSTOMER SERVICE 0",-0.9,Negative
"I switched my household insurance to my new e-bike and it was then classified as a new insurance and when I canceled after 3 years I had to pay a surcharge of 90 euros. I wrote to Donau and received no answer, after I called and threatened to have my bank cancel the direct debit, my representative finally got in touch. Miserable customer service",-0.7,Negative
"Called twice for a simple request, but the customer service was too incompetent to change my bank details. 2 times asked for my email address and both times received nothing!!!",-0.8,Negative
"Just spoke to the intermediary on the phone - what does he think he is? I've never experienced anything like that - for a simple piece of information, not even a claim",-0.7,Negative
"Experiences with Donau Haus and especially legal protection insurance. I was drawn into a 10-year binding contract at the time of conclusion of the contract, without any indication from the insurance agent. Of course, I should have read all the small print before signing the contract, but unfortunately I didn't. When reporting a claim, nothing was done for a long time, despite many calls and letters, by this insurance company. Only when I wanted to cancel did I get first reactions. I can only strongly advise against this insurance company !!! Never again Donau-Versicherungen! And now a prior cancellation after three years is only possible by paying around 60% of the annual premium. I call that total rip-off. Therefore my conclusion: Never again Donau-Versicherungen!

"Now I have received a letter from Donau-Versicherung on 7.9.21 in which they inform me that I will not receive the rejection of the Vienna tariff for my health insurance because of my individual medical findings, but that it is only general insurance medical considerations that were applied against me here. Now I naturally ask myself why Ms. Katharina Gold then spent weeks after the 3-day hospital findings from 2018 like the devil after a soul? If my state of health is supposedly not important? Ergo, it is now, as I have assumed, my age! WARNING",-0.5,Negative
"Warning! Only take out health insurance with Donau Versicherung if you are young and healthy, otherwise you will be like me! And above all, decide from the start for the Austria general tariff, even if the Donau Versicherung employee says that it would be cheaper with the Vienna tariff. Because if you get older or sick, you will be thrown out of the Vienna tariff again very quickly.",-0.9,Negative
"Unfortunately, I can't confirm the positive experiences here. I had a water damage claim in 2019, which was rejected because, according to Donau Versicherung, it was not covered by household insurance. In my opinion, however, it was clearly a case for household insurance. Unfortunately, I did not have legal insurance and therefore could not take any further action. Conclusion: I terminated the insurance with Donau Versicherung.",-0.8,Negative

"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Donau Versicherung. In 2018, I had a burst pipe in my apartment, which caused considerable water damage in the apartment below me. The damage was reported immediately to Donau Versicherung. The processing of the claim dragged on for months. The expert opinion commissioned by Donau Versicherung was simply implausible. In the end, I had to take legal action to get my rights. Not recommended!",-0.9,Negative
Donaudversicherung - never again! Incompetent staff!,-0.9,Negative
"Unfortunately, I can't share a positive experience here either. I had a liability claim due to a broken window pane caused by my child, which was rejected by Donau Versicherung. The reason given was that the child was playing purposefully. In my opinion, this is not a reason to reject the claim. I then switched to another insurance company.",-0.8,Negative
