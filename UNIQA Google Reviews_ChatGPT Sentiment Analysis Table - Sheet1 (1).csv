2,"The worst private insurance company. I pay every month, but still I had to pay at the doctor's office for a visit and they are not paying back! They are looking for ways not to pay their customers. Never again!",-0.95,Negative,,,
3,"This is not an insurance company, this from our car insurance experience is a scamming company that will use each and every possible little loophole in the law to trap you into policies that you can only cancel when they feel like it. So pretty much they will steal from you. Stay away!!!",-0.95,Negative,,,
4,"The company is trying to scam you out of your money at each step. First of all, they will include EVERYTHING that you potentially might have in the future. All kinds of illnesses, things that come with age. This way they are not working with statistical probability and Big Data that works on large numbers. They make sure they profit from each and every customer, even if all insurance cases will occur. So at no risk for UNIQA. Second, even in cases where you followed the procedures and forwarded invoices to the company, they try to weasel out of payment. Claiming that they are unable to wire the money due to some missing information they don't try to solve it. They just close a case at every step in hope that a customer busy and forgets about this or is too tired to jump over all the hops. Not sure whether other private insurance companies are better (probably not), but this is my experience with this one. EDIT: 14 days later after complaint via E-Mail and the App and still no progress. One would think that the company will use the chance to make things right, but apparently not this one.",-0.85,Negative,,,
5,"My experience with this insurance company begun with question of immediate getting the insurance for residence permit. Here everything was smooth and fast. Later I had an accident and then money were returned but not as fast as expected eventhough I had all documents needed. Until this point I had recommended this company. When I had to cancel my insurance something strange happened: they ""couldn't charge"" money from my account and waited 4 months to inform me! Added extra fee and told to pay. Email was from new email address, no stamps or signatures - just information. I tried to find out was it a spam or not but didn't get it. After 8!!! months I was contacted again with the same request. Appeared that it might be not a spam and it was explained to me why but still no stamps or anything official. Total anarchy and low level of service. Definitely wouldn't recommend now. P.S. I paid that amount in order to forget about it but still not sure if it was right decision or not.",-0.75,Negative,,,

Reason: The parked car was in reverse. After refuting this absurd theory, the insurance still does not cover it. Reason: According to the expert, the damage could not have occurred like this.
